# Document Chunking

This code takes long text as an input and chunks the text into smaller groups. 

Chunks are split at sentance boundaries after a minimum number of "tokens" has been reached, also each chunk has one overlapping sentance with its neighbors by default. 

This chunking schema is useful for text similarity search and natural language processing tasks such as NVIDIA's chat with RTX. 

&nbsp;

## Dependencies

This code uses the following libraries:
- `streamlit`: for building the user interface.
- `pandas`: for manipulating dataframes 

&nbsp;

## Usage

Run the following commands:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the local Streamlit server, and you can access the chatbot by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.
